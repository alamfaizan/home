		<h2>Introduction</h2>
		<p> When you study robots, it is called robotics, in robotics, you will be introduced to many things like gears, motors, pistons, pneumatic system and hydraulic systems. You can visit this site found on one of NASA's page to learn more.<a href="https://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/k-4/stories/nasa-knows/what_is_robotics_k4.html">(NASA, 2009)</a></p>
		<p>Now robotics engineering is a job that stems off of the study of robots, as an engineer of a robot you must be able to either program, design or build a robot. There is a lot of stress for these engineers however, they have long work hours and very busy schedules, but they do get paid a lot, to know exactly how much and a lot of other cool information, go to this link here and find out if robotics engineering is right for you. <a href="https://www.sokanu.com/careers/robotics-engineer/">(Sokanu,2017)</a></p>

		<h2>Robotics Team at Victoria Park</h2>
		<p>Here at Victoria Park, there is a robotics team, it shows a very good example of what robotics is a real job, except it's a bit more fun. In this team of nearly 100 people per year, the team is forced under pressure to design, build and program a functioning robot to be able to compete at competitions. Here is a YouTube link to see what that's like.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EMiNmJW7enI">(First Robotics Competition,2017)</a>Each year the game changes, so there is no real way of telling what's in store until First Robotics releases, now that's how you get students to anticipate for something, by just giving them hints and teasers of the final product. There are also lots of competitions to participate in so it not just over in one shot and a lot of new experiences.</p>
		<h2>Post Secondary</h2>
		<p>There are many post-secondary schools now, that take in engineering such as, mechanical, electrical and computers a good example is Centennial College, they have Electro-Mechanical Engineering Technology – Automation and Robotics as one of their programs, it's 3 years/6 semesters long and gives you a hands-on experience, their website is right here as well if you wish to learn more than check out their website right here<a href=" http://www.centennialcollege.ca/programs-courses/full-time/electro-mechanical-engineering-technology-automation-and-robotics/#panelOne">(Centennial College,2017)</a></p>
		<p>Other post-secondary schools that offer good engineering programs are UofT(university of Toronto) <a href="http://engsci.utoronto.ca/explore_our_program/majors/roboticsengineeringoption/">(Faculty of Applied Science & Engineering,2017)</a> and Waterloo <a href="https://uwaterloo.ca/mechanical-mechatronics-engineering/">(University of Waterloo,2017)</a></p>
		<h2>Why I chose Robotics Engineering?</h2>
		<p>This is the path career that I want to take because it is something I'm really interested in, ever since grade 7 when I was building robots out of Lego. I really love how we start from scratch every year and just somehow through a lot of work and determination we end up building a robot that is able to function at the competitions we go to. So that we can bring home a victory banner and say we accomplished our goal, which is aside from everything else that is our goal. I enjoy how more and more things are relying on robots to do, that promises good growth for the job, and how much money I get to make as well, since then I don't have to worry about the income. Also, I love the work that is required in making each robot, it's as simple as that. That concludes my report on Robotics.</p>
		<p>THE END!!!!
