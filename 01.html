		<h1>My Super Power</h1>
		<p>My super power is having a very high pain threshold, I can endure a lot of pain before surrendering to it, this leads to me being very strong. I remember back in elementary school I used to play soccer with my friends and I always used to get hit by a soccer ball in the face and I used to be able to just shake it off. I never used to understand why I was the one to be able to stand up to all this pain, while others succumb to things like scrapes and cuts. Now through the years, I learned that I just have a natural power of resisting a lot of pain.</p>
		<h2>The Origins</h2>
		<p>Now I said that the origin of my powers was around the time I was young, and that is true, sort of see I'm born with this power, but I didn't find out until I was 9 years old. Before I started enhancing this power of mine, I first had to test my limits and so I did, when I was younger I used to train with my dad. That's where I found out my limits are very high since I could take an abnormal amount of pain for a kid. Like 30 push-ups at age 10 and planking for a long time. Now I practice by myself, always increasing my endurance of pain, so I can get stronger.</p>
		<h3>What My Future Goals are for My Powers.</h3>
		<p>Since I am able to endure lots of pain, I plan on using my power to help me get stronger and faster since I won't suffer from all the pain that goes into it. If I can get strong enough I'll be able to help other people in need, maybe even teach them how to become stronger, like a personal coach. Who knows, I mainly focus in the science fields, but what I do know is that if there's no pain, there's no gain.</p>
